# QRL Core Library

**Jay**
The test for measuring the time of key generation/the time of encrypting json plaintext/the time of decrypting the json plaintext/length of cipher message is added.
How to Build:

1. git clone dilithium/kyber/PicoSHA2/xmss-reference to folder, deps
2. cmake .
3. need add extern "C" to all global varibles in deps/kyber/ref/precomp.c becasuse g++ will add mangling automatically. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/524633/how-can-i-avoid-name-mangling
4. build it



*WARNING: This is work in progress, changes might not be backward compatible.*

This library currently exposes the following functionality:  

- XMSS, XMSS_fast
- Shake128, Shake256, SHA2_256
- Hashchain seeds, etc.
- Helpers: seed generation, address generation, mnemonics

## Installing

#### Ubuntu
```
sudo apt -y install swig3.0 python3-dev build-essential cmake ninja-build pkg-config
pip3 install pyqrllib
````

#### OSX

If you dont have brew yet, we think you should :) Install brew following the instructions here: [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/)

Now install some dependencies

```bash
brew install cmake python3 swig
pip3 install pyqrllib
```

#### Windows
```
TBD
```

#### Raspbian

```
sudo apt -y install swig3.0 python3-dev build-essential cmake ninja-build
sudo pip3 install -U setuptools
sudo pip3 install -U pyqrllib
```

#### Miscellaneous

Golang and Java wrappers are currently experimental (By default they are disabled in cmake)

```
brew install go --cross-compile-common
```

## Development

#### Emscripten

In order to compile the webassembly and run node.js tests you first need to install CircleCI CLI:

https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-cli/#installing-the-circleci-local-cli-on-macos-and-linux-distros

Then run the following command

```
circleci build --job build_emscripten
```

This will compile and test the webassembly. Output files will be copied over to `tests/js/tmp`

You can then run node.js locally using npm.
